          <p>Hey there, I'm Ayse, a Chicago-based designer who loves creating designs that are both fun and functional. I'm always down for freelance work and collaborating with nonprofits and small businesses, especially in areas that align with my interests like food, art, fashion, makeup, healthcare, and mental health. It's exciting for me to use my design skills to help organizations that make a positive impact on their communities.When it comes to my design process, I'm all about experimenting with bold colors, unique typography, and unconventional layouts to create visually engaging experiences. But I also believe in taking a traditional approach to design by researching, prototyping, and testing to make sure designs are not only beautiful, but also user-friendly and accessible.My previous career in therapy has given me a unique perspective on design, emphasizing the importance of empathy and understanding users' needs. I always strive to design products that are inclusive and easy to use for everyone.In my free time, I love going on long walks, binge-watching TV shows, and testing out new cooking recipes. It keeps my mind moving with new inspiration and helps me bring fresh ideas to my work.
